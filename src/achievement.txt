I have 2 achievement I want to say that I'm proud of.

IT Related: Honestly I think graduating from college would be one of my proudest achievements
so far. Mainly because there were several bumps along the way. However, I didn't give up and here I am.

Not IT related: I represented Ireland as a Paralympic football player for 6 years. This involved playing in tournaments
 and friendlies at home and abroad.
